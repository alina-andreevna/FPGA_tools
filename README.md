Easy tools for all designs

**async_preset** - form strobe for one clk period after the appearance of an asynchronous signal at the input port.

**cdc_pulse** - module to clock domain crossing single pulse with measured frequency of domains.

**complex_multiplier** - pipline module multiply two complex numbers with small device area.

**debouncer** - module for eliminating bounce of input ports.

**front_detector** - generate pulse to changed edge type.

**strobe_gen** - generate single pulse with user's start and duration after start clk.

**functions** - package with often used functions.

**sort** - module for growing sort pipeline input values with clock domain crossing.

**window analysis** - module for calculate mean value, max value and index of max value. 

**template.vhd** - universal template file for new .vhd modules
